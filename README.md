# VSIntelliSenseTweaks
Features:
  - Enhanced filtering algorithm improves matching between your typed text and avalable items.
    - Experience less 'no suggestions'.
    - Unlike default algorithm, allows matching to start in the middle of a word.
  - Multi caret/selection intelliSense support.
    - Place two or more carets and trigger word completion (currently hard coded to ctrl + space) and use intelliSense like you are used to in other editors such as VS code.
